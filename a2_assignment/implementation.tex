\subsection{Implementation}

    The models were implemented in Python, using the Scitkit-learn library, with the assistance of NumPy. Text preprocessing was done using the spaCy library, and graphics were plotted using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly libraries. The implementation is available at \href{https://github.com/lucasresck/machine-learning/}{https://github.com/lucasresck/machine-learning/} and can be better visualized \href{https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lucasresck/machine-learning/blob/main/notebooks/a2_assignment.ipynb}{here}.
