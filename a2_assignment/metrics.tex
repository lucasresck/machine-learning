\subsection{Performance metrics}

    Most of our algorithms are supervised and multiclass. The most suitable performance metric is the test accuracy, basically the ratio between hits and tries. We also present some test intraclass metrics, such as class precision (the fraction of BP $k$ predicted documents that are correct, for some BP $k$) and class recall (the fraction of correct BP $k$ documents that were correctly predicted, for some BP $k$). In general, we also present a test confusion matrix, which shows how many test documents were predicted in each class.
