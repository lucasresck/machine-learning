The Brazilian Supreme Court (STF) frequently cites what is called ``SÃºmula Vinculante,'' or Binding Precedent (BP), in their decisions. 58 BPs were have already been created until today. It seems trivial that documents that cite the same precedents have the same subjects, and documents that cite different precedents have different subjects. In this work, we explore if this is also trivial for machine learning models, \ie, how traditional machine learning models can learn to ``separate'' these documents according to precedent citations, particularly Binding Precedents. We begin with an exploration of the dataset; we explain the methodology of the experiments; we adjust several supervised and unsupervised models; we discuss the results. The main result is the fact that the documents are very separable, even linearly separable, according to the BP citations.
